### Analysis Summary

I can help you with that! To create a diagram, I need to know what you'd like to diagram. Please tell me:

1.  **What specific part of the codebase are you interested in?** (e.g., "the overall architecture," "the user authentication flow," "the `OrderService` module").
2.  **What level of detail do you need?** (e.g., "high-level components," "interactions between specific classes," "the internal structure of a single file").

Once I have this information, I can use my tools to gather the necessary details and generate a comprehensive diagram for you.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Diagram Generation Process**
   The system is designed to assist users in generating diagrams of their codebase. It requires user input to understand the specific part of the codebase to diagram and the desired level of detail. This initial interaction is crucial for tailoring the diagram generation process.
