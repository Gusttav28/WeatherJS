# WeatherJS
WeatherJS is the frontend implementation of a weather application powered by a Django REST Framework (DRF) backend. The main objective of this project is to practice and enhance frontend development skills using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, while consuming a custom weather API made it with DRF. The project also integrates amCharts 5 (am5) for dynamic and interactive data visualization, enabling a better user experience through real-time chart rendering of weather-related data.

🌐 Live Demo
You can access the deployed version of the project at the following link:

👉 [Live Weather App](https://weather-bygus.vercel.app/)

🗂 Backend Repository
The Django REST Framework (DRF) backend used for this project is available in the following repository:

👉 [Weather API - DRF Backend](https://github.com/Gusttav28/Django-Weather-API) remember to run this project first in your local host in order to have the backend server available.

## 🚀 Project Objective
This project was created to strengthen the understanding of how frontend technologies interact with RESTful APIs. It focuses not only on fetching and displaying data, but also on presenting it in an intuitive and user-friendly way using modern visualization libraries.

## 🧩 Features
- Integration with a Django REST Framework weather API.

- Fetch and display real-time weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).

- Use of amCharts 5 to visualize weather metrics through charts and graphs.

- Responsive and minimalist UI built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Clear code structure designed for scalability and further integration (e.g., Next.js version).

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Frontend: JavaScript (Vanilla), HTML5, CSS3

- Visualization: amCharts 5

- Backend: Django REST Framework (external repository)

- API Communication: Fetch API using JSON responses

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
- Make sure the Django REST API is running and accessible.

- Clone this repository and open the index.html file in your browser, or serve it using a local web server.

- The application will automatically fetch data from the API and render it visually using amCharts.


## 🧪 Future Plans
- Build an alternative frontend using React and Next.js for comparison and practice.

- Add user location-based weather fetching.

- Improve UI design with a focus on accessibility and responsiveness.

- Add support for additional metrics such as air quality and UV index.

# Conclusion
WeatherJS is a simple yet effective project to explore API consumption and frontend development with JavaScript. With the integration of amCharts 5, it also provides a strong foundation for building visually rich applications. It serves as both a learning resource and a base for more advanced weather tracking platforms.
